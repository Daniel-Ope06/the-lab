# N-Body Gravity & Trajectory Optimization

## The Concept

Build a high-precision solar system simulation that visualizes the "Three-Body Problem" or calculates the most efficient fuel path (Hohmann Transfer) between planets.

## The Workflow

* **Python:** Write the core math logic using **NumPy** or **SciPy** to calculate the gravitational forces and orbital paths accurately.
* **Godot:** Use Godot strictly as the "Visualization Layer" to render the planets and trails in real-time 2D.
* **Bonus:** Add a "Launch" button that calculates the precise angle/thrust needed to get a rocket from Earth to Mars using the physics engine.

## The Deployment

* A playable game on itch.io (web, windows & mac).
* Use 2D art assets based on QZed characters and branding.
* Publish to QZed website for others to discover.
