# Three-Body Chaos: Orbital Survival

## 🌌 The Concept

**Three Suns. One Doomed Planet. Can you escape?**

Inspired by the *Three-Body Problem* Netflix series, this project simulates a solar system trapped in gravitational chaos. You are the navigator for a civilization living on the edge of destruction. The stars look stable now, but the math says doom is coming.

## 🔭 The Simulation

> **Visualizing Level 1: "False Stability"**
>
> The planet (Cyan) circles the Red Sun. It looks safe, but watch the Yellow and Orange suns. Their gravity is slowly pulling the planet into a heat trap.

## 🎮 The Gameplay

Gravity is your enemy, but also your only way out.

- **The Trap:** The simulation generates *metastable* scenarios. The orbit looks safe, but in the near future the suns will align to crush your planet.
- **The Prediction:** Use the simulation to look into the future and find the exact moment the physics breaks.
- **The Escape:**

## 🛠 The Workflow

- **The Lab (Python):** Where we prototype the hard science. We are building a custom physics engine to simulate realistic N-Body gravity and predict chaotic orbits.
- **The Game (Godot):** Where we bring it to life. The final version will be a 2D game with interactive flight controls and mission planning.

## 🚀 The Plan

- **Release:** A free game on itch.io (Web, Windows, Mac).
- **Art:** Featuring *QZed* characters and style.
- **Goal:** A showcase of real physics powering fun gameplay.
